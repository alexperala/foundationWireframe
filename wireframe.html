        <p class="text-center">Samantha and Tim met while vacationing in Nicaragua in 2004. After travelling together for several months, they returned home – Samatha to Toronto, Canada and Tim to Brisbane, Australia. Despite time and distance, they never forgot each other and after a few years of Skype calls and visits, they decided to move to Nicaragua together and buy a hostel. They found Deep Lagoon, bought it, and the rest is history.</p>

        <p class="text-center">“Look beyond the great design, the glorious sunset view, the charming service and cleansing sea breeze... you'll see the world in a better light and you'll find one of Nicaragua's most relaxed and authentic experiences." – Stacey McCall, Hostel Guest (2013)</p>
        <p class="text-center">Nicaragua is one of my favorite destinations in the world and Deep Lagoon is one of my absolute favorite hotels. This is the kind of place that you take your shoes off as soon as you walk in and never put them back on. This is definitely one of those great gems. But whether you're taking a dip in the great pool or you're watching the stunning sunsets with a glass of Flor de Cana in hand–this is a place I would recommend to anyone."</p>
        <p class="text-center">"The 20-room hostel was small enough that we could book the whole compound for our yoga retreat, guaranteeing our guests a truly private getaway. More important, though, was the friendly spirit of the place and the people who work there. “By the end, the entire staff was part of the experience,” explains the bride. “Even the maintenance men would stop and cut you down a coconut."</p>
